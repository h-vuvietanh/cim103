        <h1>Toby Fox</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 18px"><strong>Toby Fox</strong>, real name <u>Robert F. Fox</u>, is an American musician and game developer. 
            He was born on October 11, 1991 in Manchester, New Hampshire and had an interest 
            in music creation ever since he was a kid. Toby is an alumnus of Northeastern 
            University's class of 2014 and held a degree in environmental science. </p>

            <h2>Inspiration and Early Works</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18px">Toby fell in love with role-playing games thanks to his experience with 
                Final Fantasy VI and several Japanese works, most notably EarthBound, 
                Secret of Mana, Super Mario RPG, and Touhou Project. These inspirations 
                can be seen in his style of composing and the video games he later developed.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 18px">Fox's most notable programming creation in his teenage years is a 
                Halloween-themed ROM hack of the 2008 video game Earthbound, aptly 
                named EarthBound Halloween Hack. It is here that the earliest draft 
                of his most famous song, Megalovania, first appeared. He later reused 
                this song for the multimedia webcomic Homestuck. Toby's musical contributions 
                to Homestuck has helped him gain some traction among the online community as a 
                talented composer. During this period, he worked under the alias <em>Radiation</em> / <em>FwugRadiation</em>.</p>

            <h2>Undertale and Deltarune</h2>
            <p style="font-size: 18px"><a href="https://www.undertale.com">Undertale</a>, a meta-fictional video game released in 2015, is Toby Fox's most influential 
                and well-known work. The game was mostly developed by Toby and the artist Temmie Chang, 
                and they took some inspiration from earlier-mentioned works, such as the bullet hell 
                combat system of Touhou Project and the atmosphere of EarthBound. The game's success 
                can be attributed to its unique, charming cast of characters, how Undertale went against 
                many pre-established tropes of the role-playing game genre, and the way game mechanics 
                intertwined itself with the story. The internet was <em>obsessed</em> with Undertale, creating 
                a huge fanbase with many derivative works whose popularity rivals the original game itself. 
                Toby did not anticipate the pop-culture phenomenon his creation would create, and initially 
                remarked the attention as overwhelming: <q>Not only did I not expect this level of popularity, but initially, I was afraid of it.</q></p>
                <!-- Quote source: https://www.tumblr.com/undertale/150397346860/retrospective-on-undertales-popularity -->
            <p style="font-size: 18px">Three years later, Toby Fox released the first chapter of <a href="https://www.deltarune.com">Deltarune</a> -- another role-playing 
                game featuring some characters from Undertale and can be considered its spinoff. Deltarune 
                was created in an episodic nature, meaning that chapters of the game would be released 
                occasionally over the course of several years. While it was initially overshadowed by the 
                predecessor Undertale, the game gradually established its own identity with the release of 
                Chapter 2 in 2021 and Chapter 3 + 4 in 2025, with arguably better artworks and storytelling 
                than what was seen in Toby's older works. Fox has remarked that Deltarune is his dream creation 
                and Undertale, despite its huge success and impact, was intended to be an experiment to see 
                whether or not his ambition can become true.</p>
